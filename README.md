# perceptron-classifier
My foray into practical AI. This project builds a simple linear classifier from scratch.

# Background
The perceptron is one of the earliest supervised learning algorithms used for binary classification. It works only on **linearly separable data**, adjusting weights using a simple update rule until all training data are correctly classified.

# Features
- Binary classification based on a line (e.g., 4x₁ + 5x₂ - 4 = 0)
- Manual generation of training data
- Hand-coded training logic and updates
- Visualization of learned decision boundary
